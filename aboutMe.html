                    I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.</p>
                    <p class="blog-detail"> Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that
                        I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>

                <p class="blog-detail"> <span class="bold">I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</span>, I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
                <p class="blog-detail">  It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>

                <p class="blog-detail"> Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. 
                    I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
                <p class="blog-detail"> With how much it turned my life around, 
                  <span class="bold">  I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it</span>,
                     and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well,
                  which is why I started this site!</p>
